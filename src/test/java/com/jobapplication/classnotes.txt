Epic 01: SDET Job Application

User Story 001 ->
  As an Applicant, I should be able to provide my personal
  information so that Employer can contact me.

User Story 002 ->
    As an Applicant, I should be able to describe my skills
    so that Employer can match my skills for the position.


Product backlog: Epic 01, Story 001, Story 002

Story 001 > P1
Story 002 > P2

Sprint #1:
  Sprint backlog: Story 001
  Length: 2 weeks
  Story points(Fibonacci): 5

1,2,3,5,8,13,21
One point is 8 hours.
=======================

Test cases for Story 001:

    Positive, Negative Scenarios.
    Boundary value analysis etc.

Test case #001:
    TC Description: Full name must be mandatory
    1. Given I am on SDET Job application page
    2. When I provide empty full name information
    3. And I click next
    4. Then error message "Enter a value for this field."
       should be displayed

You are assigned to test a user story:
  what steps you take to test and automate it?

  1. Analyze user story
  2. Wrote test cases based on positive or negative scenarios
  3. Manually test it
  4. if no bugs then start automation
     else log the defect and reject automation

Story > Diff scenarios(positive, negative) > for each scenario, test cases
Test to break it!

driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

Implicit wait needs to set up only once in the beginning And
it applies for all selenium steps.

(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS) -> it will wait up to 30 seconds for
the element to appear in html code.


GETTEXT() METHOD  -> returns a visible text on the page.
and in HTML it will be between opening and closing tags.
 <p>Some text</p>

GETATTIBUTE("VALUE") -> for input boxes, it will return the
value that was inserted into the box.
========================

Homework:
  1) Finish all step and click on Apply
  2) Validate each value
    IP address: goto google and search for what is my ip
  3) Goto your email and find the email and click on it
  by id. SDET Application #id
